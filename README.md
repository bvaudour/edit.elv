# xiaq's collections of Elvish editor plugins

Here is a collection of editor plugins useful for
[Elvish](https://github.com/elves/elvish), the friendly and expressive shell.

These scripts always target Elvish HEAD. If they do not work for you, it is
usually because you are not running HEAD.

Install with `epm`:

```sh
epm:install github.com/xiaq/edit.elv
```

Usage comments in individual files assume that you have installed this library
in this way.
